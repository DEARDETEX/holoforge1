<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to set up the HoloForge 3D hologram SaaS project by cloning a repository and installing its dependencies. The project has since evolved through a series of detailed Product Design Requirements (PDRs) provided by the user, who is acting as a Senior Developer/CTO.

The current set of tasks involves transforming the MVP into a production-ready application. This includes:
1.  **Fix Critical Rendering Issues:** Implement a production-grade, Blender-inspired multi-mesh loading solution for both  and  file formats to fix issues where models were only partially rendered. (This part is complete).
2.  **Refactor Frontend Loading:** Create a plugin-based architecture for model loaders (, ) to make adding new file formats easier in the future. (This is created but not yet integrated).
3.  **Build a Backend Export System:** Create a robust, strategy-pattern-based system in the FastAPI backend for exporting rendered holograms to various video formats (MP4, GIF, WebM with Alpha).
4.  **Create Backend API:** Expose the export system via a production-grade REST API with background processing, status polling, and authentication.
5.  **Build Frontend UI for Export:** Integrate the frontend with the new export API by creating a service layer, a custom React hook, and UI components (, ) for a seamless user experience.

The project is currently at the stage of building the frontend UI for the export functionality.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a functional full-stack application for rendering 3D models as holograms.
-   **Backend (FastAPI):** A production-grade video export system has been fully implemented and tested. It uses the Strategy Pattern to manage different export formats (MP4, GIF, WebM with transparency) via an . This system is exposed through a complete REST API at , which supports asynchronous job processing, status polling, and downloads. The  dependency has been installed.
-   **Frontend (React/Three.js):** The  component can correctly render complex multi-mesh OBJ and GLB models using a robust, Blender-inspired loading logic. A more advanced, plugin-based architecture for model loading (, , ) has been created in  but is **not yet integrated** into . The foundational pieces for the export UI ( and  hook) have been planned, and the next step is to build the UI components themselves.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The agent was about to start the implementation of the frontend UI components for the export feature, specifically the  component and its associated CSS, as per the user's detailed PDR.
-   Status: **NOT STARTED**
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? **Frontend testing agent** (after the UI components are built and integrated).
-   User Testing Done: N

Do you want to continue? [Y/n] Abort.. This works temporarily.
     - **Next debug checklist**: If the backend fails to start or the  endpoint fails, the first step should be to run  to check if it's installed and in the PATH. If not, reinstall it.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The entire backend video export functionality depends on . Ensuring it's stable is critical for the application to work.
     - **Status**: **RESOLVED** (for now, but recurrence is possible)
     - **Is recurring issue?** Y
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** backend
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: Refactor  to use the new  (Priority: P1)

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1: 
     - **Where to resume**: The plugin architecture (, , etc.) exists in . The next step is to modify , remove the large  block for  and , and replace it with a call to the  method.
     - **What will be achieved with this?** This will complete the strategic refactoring, making the model loading system extensible, cleaner, and easier to maintain. It will make adding future formats (like FBX) trivial.
     - **Status**:  **NOT STARTED**
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** frontend
     - **Blocked on something**: Blocked by the user's current PDR, which prioritizes building the export UI first. This task should be done after the export UI is complete.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks (P0):**
    1.  **Implement Export UI Components**: Create , , and  as per the latest user PDR to allow users to interact with the export functionality.
- **Future Tasks (from user's long-term plan):**
    1.  **4K Support & Camera Controls (P1):** Enhance the viewer with 4K rendering capabilities and advanced camera manipulation tools.
    2.  **Background Video Rendering (P1):** Allow users to render holograms over a video background.
    3.  **Comprehensive Testing (P2):** Write and execute end-to-end tests for the entire application flow.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Initial Project Setup:** Cloned the Git repository and installed all backend and frontend dependencies.
- **Multi-Mesh Rendering Fix:** Implemented a production-grade, Blender-inspired loading logic in  that correctly renders complex, multi-part OBJ and GLB models.
- **Backend Export System (Strategy Pattern):** Created a fully modular and extensible video export system in the backend.
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
- **Backend Export Manager:** Implemented  to orchestrate all export strategies.
- **Backend Export API:** Created a complete, asynchronous REST API at  to handle export requests, status polling, and downloads.
- **Frontend Model Loader Architecture:** Created the files for a new plugin-based architecture for model loading (e.g., ), though it is not yet integrated.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. The agent has diligently addressed all issues raised by the user, although some required multiple iterations to get to the final, production-grade solution.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: The  dependency has proven to be unstable within this session, requiring re-installation.
- **Recurrence count**: 2
- **Status**: **RESOLVED** (but should be monitored)

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Asynchronous Tasks (), Strategy Design Pattern,  for video processing.
-   **Frontend**: React, Three.js, React Hooks, , ,  for advanced geometry manipulation.
-   **Architecture**: Plugin Architecture, REST API Design, Service Layer in Frontend.

**key DB schema**
-   No database schema changes have been made. The application uses MongoDB for model metadata, but recent work has focused on file processing.

**changes in tech stack**
-    has been added as a core backend dependency for video processing.

**All files**
-   **Created/Updated (Backend):**
    -   : Defines the abstract base class for all video exporters.
    -   , , : Concrete implementations for different export formats.
    -   : Orchestrates the different export strategies.
    -   : Exposes the export functionality via a REST API.
    -   : Modified to integrate the new export API router.
-   **Created (Frontend - Not yet integrated):**
    -   , , : The foundation for the new extensible model loading system.
    -   , : The existing loader logic refactored into plugins.
-   **Updated (Frontend):**
    -   : Significantly updated with production-grade, multi-mesh loading logic for OBJ and GLB files.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   : The component's model loading logic needs to be refactored to use the new  system located in . This will replace the large, hardcoded  block and complete the strategic architecture improvement.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Initiates a new video export job.
-   : Polls for the status of an ongoing export job.
-   : Downloads the completed video file.
-   : Returns the capabilities of the backend export system (supported formats, qualities, etc.).
-   : Retrieves the user's export history.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **Follow PDRs Exactly:** The user provides extremely detailed, production-grade PDRs. Adhere to them closely, including file paths, class names, and code logic. They represent the architectural vision for the project.
2.  **Pending Refactor:** A complete, plugin-based architecture for model loading has been created in  but is **not yet active**. The  component still uses the old  logic. This refactoring is a pending task but the user has prioritized building the export UI first.
3.  **FFmpeg Dependency:** The  command-line tool is a critical backend dependency. If the backend fails to start or export-related APIs fail, the first step is to verify  is installed and in the system's PATH ().
